# UiPath Component Design

Hide substantial behavior behind a small, stable contract so callers gain leverage, maintainers gain locality, and tests exercise the same seam used in production.

**Maturity:** core.

## Ownership Boundary

**This custom skill owns:** Hide substantial behavior behind a small, stable contract so callers gain leverage, maintainers gain locality, and tests exercise the same seam used in production.

It does not own current UiPath product commands, schemas, artifact validation, live tenant operations, or policy administration unless its instructions explicitly say otherwise.

## Compose With Official UiPath Skills

Use official skills for current product commands and artifact contracts:

- `uipath-rpa`
- `uipath-agents`
- `uipath-maestro-flow`
- `uipath-maestro-bpmn`
- `uipath-maestro-case`
- `uipath-api-workflow`
- `uipath-human-in-the-loop`

Read [references/official-uipath-skill-map.md](references/official-uipath-skill-map.md) when routing is unclear.

## Workflow

### 1. Define behavior and callers

State the business capability, callers, inputs, outputs, invariants, error modes, performance expectations, audit needs, and what must remain hidden.

**Completion criterion:** The contract can be judged independently of implementation.

### 2. Choose the seam

Place the public seam at the highest practical boundary used by real callers and tests. Introduce an adapter only where behavior actually varies or an external dependency must be isolated.

**Completion criterion:** The seam and its reason are explicit.

### 3. Design it more than once

Produce at least three radically different contract shapes: minimal common-case, explicit stateful, and extensible or event-oriented. Include representative usage and hidden complexity for each.

**Completion criterion:** The options differ in more than naming.

### 4. Compare the options

Evaluate interface size, correct-use ergonomics, misuse risk, observability, testability, versioning, locality, leverage, platform fit, and operational burden.

**Completion criterion:** Trade-offs are visible without assuming the first design wins.

### 5. Select and specify

Choose or synthesize the strongest design, define the contract and acceptance examples, and identify which official UiPath skill owns implementation.

**Completion criterion:** An implementer can build through the selected seam.

### 6. Verify depth

Apply the deletion test: removing the component should redistribute meaningful complexity to callers rather than simply eliminate pass-through code.

**Completion criterion:** The selected component earns its abstraction cost.

## Output Contract

- Caller and behavior brief.
- Three or more contrasting designs.
- Trade-off analysis.
- Selected contract with acceptance examples.
- Official implementation route.

## Guardrails

- Do not implement during interface exploration.
- Do not add extension points without a current variation.
- Do not expose selectors, credentials, vendor payload quirks, or retry mechanics unless callers must control them.
- Do not create pass-through wrappers that add no leverage.

## Example Requests

- "Design a reusable email-intake component."
- "Compare queue transaction contracts for a dispatcher and performer."
- "Design the boundary between Maestro and an RPA process."

## Finish

End with what was completed, the evidence produced, the next official skill or owner, and every unresolved blocker. Never imply that a write, validation, test, deployment, policy change, tenant operation, or runtime action occurred unless it actually ran and its result was observed.
