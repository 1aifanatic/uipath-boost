description: "Develop clear UiPath solution narratives from raw notes, evidence, design artifacts, demos, and implementation outcomes. Use when preparing executive proposals, architecture explanations, demo scripts, community talks, case studies, articles, release communications, or customer-facing stories that must introduce concepts in a logical order and preserve source truth."

# UiPath Solution Storytelling

Separate exploration from shaping, ground every concept before relying on it, and build the narrative incrementally so technical credibility and audience comprehension survive editing.

**Maturity:** pilot.

## Ownership Boundary

**This custom skill owns:** Separate exploration from shaping, ground every concept before relying on it, and build the narrative incrementally so technical credibility and audience comprehension survive editing.

It does not own current UiPath product commands, schemas, artifact validation, live tenant operations, or policy administration unless its instructions explicitly say otherwise.

## Workflow

### 1. Choose the mode

Use fragment mode to collect raw observations, shape mode to turn a fixed pile into a structured piece, beat mode to build an interactive journey, or edit mode to improve an existing draft.

**Completion criterion:** The session has one writing objective and one source document.

### 2. Define audience and prerequisites

State the audience, decision or behavior the story should influence, what readers already understand, format, length, channel, and evidence standard.

**Completion criterion:** The narrative can be evaluated against an audience outcome.

### 3. Inventory and verify the source pile

Read notes, SDD, architecture, metrics, screenshots, demo results, quotations, and claims. Mark missing evidence, confidentiality, and facts requiring current verification.

**Completion criterion:** Every major claim is supported, labeled inference, or removed.

### 4. Ground concepts in order

Track concepts the audience already knows and introduce each new term, product, pattern, or business rule before a later section depends on it.

**Completion criterion:** No section relies on an unintroduced load-bearing concept.

### 5. Build incrementally

Offer contrasting openings or next beats, write only the selected block, reread the saved draft, and preserve user edits before continuing.

**Completion criterion:** Each block earns its place and creates a clear next move.

### 6. Choose the right form

Use prose for argument, lists for parallel items, tables for repeated fields, diagrams for relationships, code only when it clarifies, and callouts only for true side paths.

**Completion criterion:** Formatting supports the message rather than decorating it.

### 7. Finish and fact-check

Check the opening promise, logical dependency order, examples, calls to action, citations, confidentiality, and channel constraints. Keep unused fragments outside the final piece.

**Completion criterion:** The final narrative is coherent, evidence-backed, and audience-ready.

## Output Contract

- Raw fragment file or structured source pile.
- Audience and prerequisite brief.
- Incrementally authored narrative.
- Evidence and fact-check record.
- Final demo, article, proposal, or presentation script.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent customer outcomes, product capabilities, metrics, or quotations.
- Do not expose confidential architecture or customer data in public material.
- Do not overwrite the raw source pile while shaping a separate deliverable.
- Do not force every useful fragment into the final narrative.

## Example Requests

- "Turn this SDD and demo notes into an executive story."
- "Write a UiPath Community Day talk beat by beat."
- "Edit this automation case study for clarity and evidence."

## Finish

End with what was completed, the evidence produced, the next official skill or owner, and every unresolved blocker. Never imply that a write, validation, test, deployment, policy change, tenant operation, or runtime action occurred unless it actually ran and its result was observed.
