Use when creating a skill for discovery, architecture, development, testing, operations, governance, training, or project management; when deciding whether a workflow belongs in a custom skill or the official UiPath catalog; or when an existing skill is inconsistent, bloated, poorly triggered, or difficult to evaluate."

# UiPath Skill Authoring Guide

Make a stochastic agent follow a predictable process by giving each skill one earned job, precise invocation, checkable completion gates, progressive references, official-skill ownership, and executable tests where determinism matters.

**Maturity:** pilot.

## Ownership Boundary

**This custom skill owns:** Make a stochastic agent follow a predictable process by giving each skill one earned job, precise invocation, checkable completion gates, progressive references, official-skill ownership, and executable tests where determinism matters.

It does not own current UiPath product commands, schemas, artifact validation, live tenant operations, or policy administration unless its instructions explicitly say otherwise.

## Workflow

### 1. Prove the repeatable job

Collect concrete input and output examples, recurring failure modes, user authority boundaries, environment needs, and what should be identical in process across runs.

**Completion criterion:** The proposed skill solves a recurring task rather than a one-off prompt.

### 2. Check the official catalog first

Inspect current UiPath official skills and route product commands, artifact contracts, validation, deployment, and platform operations to their owners. Define only the complementary discipline or organization-specific convention.

**Completion criterion:** The custom skill does not fork official product truth.

### 3. Design invocation

Choose a short lowercase name and a description that states the job plus genuinely distinct trigger branches. Use a router when many user-invoked skills would be difficult to remember.

**Completion criterion:** The skill fires for its intended tasks without broadly capturing neighboring work.

### 4. Write steps with gates

Use imperative steps in execution order and end each important step with a checkable, exhaustive completion criterion. Split sequences when visibility of later steps causes premature completion.

**Completion criterion:** The agent can distinguish done from partially done at every gate.

### 5. Move detail to the right place

Keep the control plane concise. Put branch-specific rules in references, fragile deterministic operations in scripts, and output templates or reusable files in assets.

**Completion criterion:** SKILL.md remains readable and supporting resources have clear context pointers.

### 6. Add UiPath safety and composition

Name official skills, approval boundaries, data handling, environment assumptions, forbidden fabrication, evidence requirements, and what the skill never edits or executes.

**Completion criterion:** High-consequence actions and ownership are explicit.

### 7. Test, validate, and package

Run structural validation, deterministic script tests, adversarial trigger scenarios, happy and failure routes, and package validation. Record limitations and iterate from observed use.

**Completion criterion:** The packaged skill passes validation and has evidence for its critical behaviors.

## Output Contract

- Skill definition and invocation examples.
- SKILL.md with checkable gates.
- Supporting references, scripts, and assets.
- Evaluation scenarios and validation evidence.
- Packaged skill archive.

## Guardrails

- Do not copy current product commands into a custom skill when an official owner exists.
- Do not put obvious generic advice into skill context without changing behavior.
- Do not add scripts that were not actually tested.
- Do not claim runtime coverage beyond the tested environment.

## Example Requests

- "Create a skill for UiPath production readiness review."
- "Improve this oversized automation-discovery skill."
- "Decide whether this workflow belongs in the official or custom catalog."

## Finish

End with what was completed, the evidence produced, the next official skill or owner, and every unresolved blocker. Never imply that a write, validation, test, deployment, policy change, tenant operation, or runtime action occurred unless it actually ran and its result was observed.
