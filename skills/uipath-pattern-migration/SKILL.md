# UiPath Pattern Migration

Turn a wide repetitive change into an explicit contract, complete inventory, reviewed dry run, bounded batches, backups, verification, and a searchable manifest.

**Maturity:** pilot.

## Ownership Boundary

**This custom skill owns:** Turn a wide repetitive change into an explicit contract, complete inventory, reviewed dry run, bounded batches, backups, verification, and a searchable manifest.

Keep current product commands, schemas, artifact validation, live tenant operations, and policy administration with official UiPath skills.

## Workflow

### 1. Define the migration contract

State exact old forms, new forms, scope, exclusions, semantic assumptions, generated files, binary or structured artifacts requiring specialist handling, and rollback requirements.

**Completion criterion:** A reviewer can distinguish a safe match from a false positive.

### 2. Inventory every occurrence

Search all relevant projects, tests, docs, configuration, and examples. Group results by transformation class and identify ambiguous cases for manual treatment.

**Completion criterion:** Every in-scope occurrence is classified before modification.

### 3. Run a dry transformation

Use the bundled literal-text helper only for approved plain-text classes. Produce proposed changes without writing and review representative samples plus the full count.

**Completion criterion:** The dry run matches the contract and exposes no unreviewed class.

### 4. Apply bounded batches

Back up changed files, write a manifest, apply one project or transformation class at a time, and route structured UiPath artifacts to their owning official skill rather than blind text replacement.

**Completion criterion:** Each batch can be rolled back independently.

### 5. Validate after every batch

Run applicable syntax, schema, build, test, review, boundary, and solution checks. Compare expected and actual occurrence counts.

**Completion criterion:** The batch is green and the remaining inventory is known.

### 6. Complete and reconcile

Verify no approved old forms remain, no out-of-scope forms changed, every backup and manifest is present, and all manual cases are resolved or assigned.

**Completion criterion:** The migration has completeness and rollback evidence.

### 7. Retire compatibility deliberately

Remove temporary dual-write, aliases, or old contracts only after all consumers and environments are verified.

**Completion criterion:** The contract phase ends without orphaned callers.

## Output Contract

- Migration contract and inventory.
- Dry-run report.
- Backups and change manifest.
- Batch validation evidence.
- Completeness and cleanup report.

## Guardrails

- Do not use literal replacement on XAML, BPMN, JSON, or other structured artifacts without structure-aware ownership and validation.
- Do not apply a migration before reviewing the full inventory and dry run.
- Do not delete compatibility before all consumers are migrated.
- Do not omit backup and manifest evidence for automated writes.

## Example Requests

- "Rename a queue field across projects and tests."
- "Migrate environment configuration keys."
- "Replace a repeated coded-test pattern safely."

## Finish

Report completed work, observed evidence, the next official owner, and every blocker. Mark unobserved actions as pending.
