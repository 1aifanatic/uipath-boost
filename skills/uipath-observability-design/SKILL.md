description: "Design end-to-end observability for a UiPath process, agent, Maestro journey, integration, application, or multi-project solution. Use for correlation, structured events, business and technical metrics, SLOs, alert logic, dashboard requirements, runbook links, retention, and support ownership. This skill designs the model only; live job analytics belong to uipath-insights, Action Center task operations to uipath-tasks, audit events to uipath-admin, platform resources to uipath-platform, and causal diagnosis to uipath-troubleshoot."

# UiPath Observability Design

Make business and technical journeys observable through one correlation model, meaningful signals, decision-ready alerts, and a support path that can explain failures rather than only count them.

**Maturity:** core.

## Ownership Boundary

**This custom skill owns:** Make business and technical journeys observable through one correlation model, meaningful signals, decision-ready alerts, and a support path that can explain failures rather than only count them.

It does not own current UiPath product commands, schemas, artifact validation, live tenant operations, or policy administration unless its instructions explicitly say otherwise.

## Compose With Official UiPath Skills

Use official skills for current product commands and artifact contracts:

- `uipath-insights`
- `uipath-tasks`
- `uipath-admin`
- `uipath-platform`
- `uipath-governance`
- `uipath-troubleshoot`

Read [references/official-uipath-skill-map.md](references/official-uipath-skill-map.md) when routing is unclear.

## Workflow

### 1. Map the observable journey

Trace trigger, documents or messages, orchestrations, jobs, queue items, agents, human tasks, APIs, data stores, outputs, and business completion. Mark ownership and trust boundaries.

**Completion criterion:** Every critical handoff and completion state is visible on one journey map.

### 2. Define correlation

Choose business case, transaction, execution, job, queue, agent, task, integration, and release identifiers plus propagation rules and redaction requirements.

**Completion criterion:** An incident can be followed end to end without relying on free-text searches.

### 3. Choose signals and service levels

Define business outcomes, throughput, timeliness, quality, confidence, exception, retry, human aging, integration, cost, and saturation metrics. Set SLOs only where owners and measurement exist.

**Completion criterion:** Each metric answers an operational or business decision.

### 4. Design logs and traces

Specify structured events, required fields, severity, lifecycle points, error evidence, version context, sampling, retention, and links to raw evidence while avoiding secrets and sensitive payloads.

**Completion criterion:** Logs can distinguish symptom, propagation, and originating cause.

### 5. Design alerts and dashboards

Create audience-specific views and alerts with threshold or anomaly logic, deduplication, context, runbook, owner, escalation, and recovery signal.

**Completion criterion:** Every alert is actionable and every dashboard has a named user.

### 6. Check privacy, security, and cost

Review sensitive fields, tenant boundaries, access, retention, export, sampling, cardinality, storage, and AI data concerns with governance owners.

**Completion criterion:** The design meets evidence needs without uncontrolled data exposure or cost.

### 7. Walk an incident

Simulate at least one technical fault, one silent business failure, and one slow or aging path from detection through diagnosis and recovery using the proposed signals.

**Completion criterion:** The design supports a complete incident story or exposes a named gap.

## Output Contract

- End-to-end observability map.
- Correlation and structured-event schema.
- Metrics, SLO, dashboard, and alert catalog.
- Retention, privacy, and cost decisions.
- Incident walkthrough and gap list.

## Guardrails

- Design only; do not query live analytics, create dashboards, change resources, complete tasks, query audit events, or diagnose root cause.
- Do not log credentials, tokens, full sensitive documents, or unnecessary personal data.
- Do not create metrics without a decision, user, data source, or owner.
- Do not use current snapshots to explain historical incidents without correlated historical evidence.
- Do not alert on every exception without deduplication and business context.

## Example Requests

- "Design monitoring for a Maestro-orchestrated claims journey."
- "Create correlation across email intake, queue, agent, and Action Center."
- "Define dashboards and alerts before production release."

## Finish

End with what was completed, the evidence produced, the next official skill or owner, and every unresolved blocker. Never imply that a write, validation, test, deployment, policy change, tenant operation, or runtime action occurred unless it actually ran and its result was observed.
